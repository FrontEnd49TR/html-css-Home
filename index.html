1.	Write application – game for guessing word similar to the television program “Marvels Field”
1.1.	The application should present HTML element for inputting a word guess 
1.2.	The application should present the elements as many as the number of letters of being guessed word. 
1.2.1.	Each element should present an appropriate letter of being guessed word with the same background 
        and font colors, so the letter won’t be seen
1.3.	The application should present a question text related to being guessed word. For example, 
        unseen letters of word: s t r i n g, question: JavaScript Data Type
1.4.	The application should allow the user to type a word guess and hit “enter” key
1.5.	The application should take the typed word, analyze it and update the background 
        of the letters in the being guessed word for making them seen 
1.6.	The application should allow the user to play again only after guessing the word
1.6.1.	New game should present new word with a proper question
1.6.1.1.	Random word from the existing ones occasionally may be the same as the previous one. 
              The application should prevent it happening. However, it’s possible if word X follows word Y and
                 after word X there will be again word Y.
